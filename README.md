# pearce-kelly
An implementation of the Pearce-Kelly dynamic topological sorting algorithm for directed acyclic graphs (DAG). The canonical application of topological sorting is in scheduling a sequence of jobs or tasks based on their dependencies. 

# Features


- Fast tracking (performing more activities in parallel)
- Cycle detection
- Dynamic edge insertions and deletions
